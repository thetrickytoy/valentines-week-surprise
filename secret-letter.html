            <div id="letterContent" class="letter-body">
                <p>I wanted to write you this letter because some feelings are too deep for spoken words, too precious to be said just once.</p>
                
                <p>From the moment you came into my life, everything changed. The world became brighter, colors more vivid, and even ordinary moments felt magical.</p>
                
                <p>You taught me what it means to love without fear, to give without expecting, to be vulnerable and find strength in that vulnerability.</p>
                
                <p>I love the way you laugh - truly, genuinely laugh - when something catches you off guard. I love how you care so deeply about me. I love your strength, your kindness, your beautiful soul.</p>
                
                <p>I want you to know that on the days when you doubt yourself, I see your worth. When you feel small, I see your greatness. When you feel alone, I am here, always.</p>
                
                <p>This week has been my way of showing you, day by day, just a fraction of the love I carry for you in my heart.</p>
                
                <p>But the truth is, my love for you cannot be contained in a week, a month, or a year. It is infinite, eternal, boundless.</p>
                
                <p>You are my best friend, my partner, my safe place, my adventure. You are everything I didn't know I needed and everything I now cannot imagine living without.</p>
                
                <p>So here's my promise to you, written in this letter that you can return to whenever you need:</p>
                
                <p>I will love you on your best days and your worst days. I will choose you in every moment of doubt. I will stand by you through every storm and celebrate every victory. I will protect your heart, cherish your dreams, and support you in becoming whoever you wish to be.</p>
                
                <p>You deserve the world, and while I cannot give you the world, I can give you my world—my heart, my time, my devotion, my forever.</p>
                
                <p>Thank you for being you. Thank you for choosing me. Thank you for this beautiful journey we're on together.</p>
                
                <p>No matter what tomorrow brings, I want you to know this truth:</p>
                
                <p class="final-line">You are loved beyond measure, today and always.</p>
